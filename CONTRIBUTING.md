# Contributing to PullRequestBenchmark

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the PullRequestBenchmark dataset. This guide is designed to help contributors identify and document pull requests (PRs) effectively, enhancing the dataset's diversity and richness.

## Locating Suitable PRs

The goal is to populate the dataset with both approved and rejected PRs that offer a wide range of decision-making scenarios. Here's how you can locate suitable PRs on GitHub:

### For Rejected PRs

To find rejected PRs, use the GitHub search feature with the following query parameters:

```
is:pr is:closed is:merge
```

Adjust the search by adding specific keywords related to the project or technology you're interested in.

### For Approved PRs

Finding approved PRs that provide valuable learning data points is crucial. As of now, the specific search query for approved PRs is under development. However, a general approach would include:

```
is:pr is:closed is:merged 
```

Note: The search query might be refined in the future to better target PRs that meet our criteria.

## Documenting PRs

Once you have identified a suitable PR, the next step is to document it for inclusion in the PullRequestBenchmark dataset. Please collect the following information:

- **GitHub PR URL**: Provide the direct link to the PR. Example: `https://github.com/httpie/cli/pull/1178`
- **Type**: Categorize the PR. Common types include Bugfix, Feature, Improvement, Documentation, etc.
- **Rejection Reason (if applicable)**: Briefly describe the primary reason for rejection. Example: "Non-equivalent functionality"

Please ensure that the PR documentation is clear, concise, and free of any personal opinions or subjective interpretations.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution.
